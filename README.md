# Osmosis Account Generator


## ***Intentions and Causes***
   
1. Broke uni students gotta watch out for each other
2. Experimentation with browser automation, and bypassing Cloudflare's bot detection
3. Gain indirect exposure to the Node.js library "puppeteer"

## ***Note on Usage***

I think I tested it enough times that email addresses from the domain "*1secmail.com*" has been banned by Osmosis.\
If that is the case, just run the script enough times that the randomly generated email address is from an accepted domain.

## ***Disclaimer***
I don't think this is illegal, but it certainly isn't the most ethical.\
**I do not condone unethical exploitations of free trials. Use responsibly, pay if you can afford it**
